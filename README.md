This is a semi guided project which I have made. The main aim of doing this project was to get back to web development as it was over 5 months since I last touched dev. This is a full stackproject which uses ReactJS for the fronted, Django for the backend and Postgresql for the database.
Choreo was used for the deployment of this project. More further updates would be provided soon.......
